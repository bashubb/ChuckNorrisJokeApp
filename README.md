<h2>Idea</h2>

It's not a problem solving app, but a little joke can completely change even a hard day. User can display one random joke at the time, 
if it will be good, could be saved in the favorite joke list, or shared to someone by text message.

<img src="https://github.com/bashubb/ChuckNorrisJokeApp/blob/main/ChuckNorrisJokeApp%20-%20Intro%2CTabBar%2Cfirst%20joke.gif" width="40%" />
When app starts there is some animated Screen and then main view comes on. There is an Header with the name of the app, button "get joke" in the middle, and custom build animated Tab Bar in the bottom.
For every button action API is called and radomly selected joke comes on the screen.

User can use long tap gesture on the 'joke field' and then special option menu comes to play. It can be used for sharing and adding it to favorite list

When tab bar's button "favorite" is choosen view switches to the List of Favorite jokes. Every row is limited to 2 lines of text. On tap pop up comes on screen with whole text and two buttons - share and delete.
Joke can also be removed by swipe action on the list
